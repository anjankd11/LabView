# Collection of Projects and Laboratory Reports performed using Labview 

*Signal Processing : The purpose of the measurement was to present and apply the concept of virtual instrumentation 
                       and to introduce one of its software (SW) platforms, LabVIEW, a data-flow type graphical
                       programming language and integrated development environment.
                       
*Measurement Automation: The purpose of the measurement was to learn how to handle and remote control measuring
                          instruments using LabVIEW data-flow type graphical programming language.
                         
*Mobile Robot Navigation: The objective of this practical measurement session is to study the control of simple mobile platforms. The
                           study includes the understanding of signal processing methods, their algorithmic 
                           implementation and measurement based verification of the resulting behavior.
